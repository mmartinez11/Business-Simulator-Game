# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to showcase the functionality of a game called **Business Simulator**. The original game was envisioned by a group of students as part of their 
development project for the class. We took their concepts and ideas and created a working rough draft of the final game. The project contains many of the core concepts of the
game, and gives a basic idea of what the final product would look like. 

# Tools
* Java 11
* JavaFX
* Google Maps API
* JavaScript/HTML5
* Eclipse IDE

# Development 
During the initial development phase we encountered various issues, and one of them was that the Google Maps API was used primarly in JavaScript. This was a big issue because as 
a group we needed to be able to work in a language that we were all knowledgeable in. We had discussions about what language to use and we decided that using Java with JavaFX would 
be the most benificial to everyone. However, we began to have doubts over being able to use the Google Maps API with Java and JavaFX, because there were very few sources that had 
attempted to do so. We had further discussions about leaving JavaFX behind and moving on to another plataform that supported Google Maps API such as Android. Although I would of 
been more than accepting to move to a different plataform I believed that this would've severely hinder our productivity as we would've have to learn both a plataform from the
ground up while also trying to code the project. With all of this in mind I decided to dedicate a significant amount of time to find if there was any possible solution to keep 
working with JavaFX.
